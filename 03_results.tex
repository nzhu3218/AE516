\section{Results}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item plot lift and drag coeff histories for proof of convergence history for ALL Runs (appendix)
	\item Table of $C_l$, $C_d$, L/D, $C_m$
	\item plots of the items in the table and compared against Xfoil data at the closest Re \# (take directly from airfoiltools.com)
	\item streamlines and pressure contours to depict flow near airfoil
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1 plot for each case
		\item use the same contour levels
	\end{itemize}
	\item y+ curves (for $0^\circ$ AoA case)
	\item plot showing turbulent boundary layer development ($0^\circ$ AoA case)
\end{enumerate}
